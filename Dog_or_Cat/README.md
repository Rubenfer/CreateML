Use CreateMLUI to create a Machine Learning model with only TWO LINES OF CODE!

1st:
'import CreateMLUI'

2nd:
'let builder = MLImageClassifierBuilder()
builder.showInLiveView()'

3rd: You only need drag and drop training and testing images (see sample folders). Finally drag and drop into your project the model.
