Use CreateMLUI to create a Machine Learning model with only TWO LINES OF CODE!

1st:
```swift
import CreateMLUI
```

2nd:
```
let builder = MLImageClassifierBuilder()
builder.showInLiveView()
```

3rd: You only need drag and drop training and testing images (see sample folders). Finally drag and drop into your project the model.
